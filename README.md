This package provides the definition of raw (uncompressed) video frames format for the elements written with
[Membrane Multimedia Framework](https://membraneframework.org).

## Installation

Unless you're developing an Membrane Element it's unlikely that you need to
use this package directly in your app, as normally it is going to be fetched as
a dependency of any element that operates on a raw (uncompressed) video stream.

However, if you are developing an Element or need to add it due to any other
reason, just add the following line to your `deps` in the `mix.exs` and run
`mix deps.get`.

```elixir
{:membrane_raw_video_format, "~> 0.4.1"}
```
